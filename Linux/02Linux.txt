File Editing in Linux
Editing files is an essential part of working in Linux. While you can use graphical editors, much of the work in Linux is done through terminal-based text editors.
Common text editors in Linux:
Nano: A simple terminal-based editor, very beginner-friendly.
To open a file: nano filename
Basic commands:
Ctrl + X: Exit the editor.
Ctrl + O: Save the file.
Ctrl + K: Cut text.
Ctrl + U: Paste text.
Vim: A powerful and highly customizable text editor, but with a steeper learning curve.
To open a file: vim filename
Basic commands:
Press i to start editing (insert mode).
Press Esc to return to command mode.
:w to save changes.
:q to quit.
:wq to save and quit.

Emacs: Another powerful text editor, often preferred by experienced users for its extensibility.
Editing files in the terminal:
You can edit system configuration files (e.g., /etc/hostname, /etc/apt/sources.list) using these editors.
To open a file with root permissions (if required): sudo nano /etc/hostname
For simple edits, nano is recommended, while vim and emacs are more suited for advanced users.
2. Introduction to Shell Scripts
A shell script is a file containing a series of commands that the shell (Bash or another shell) can execute. Scripts automate repetitive tasks and system management tasks.
Basic Shell Script Structure:
A shell script starts with the "shebang" line, which tells the system what interpreter to use. For Bash scripts, this is:
3. Linux Security
Linux is known for its robust security features, but it is still essential to follow good security practices.

Key components of Linux security:
File Permissions: Control access to files using the chmod, chown, and chgrp commands.
Firewall: Linux uses firewalls (e.g., iptables or firewalld) to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
Check firewall status: sudo ufw status
Allow port: sudo ufw allow 22 (for SSH)
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux): A security module that provides additional security by enforcing mandatory access control policies.
AppArmor: An alternative to SELinux, used to restrict the capabilities of applications.
Auditd: The Linux auditing system to log security-relevant events, such as file access and user activities.
Best practices:
Regularly update the system: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade (for Debian-based distros).
Use strong passwords and avoid using the default root account for regular activities.
SSH key-based authentication for SSH access instead of passwords.
Install security updates regularly.

4. User and Group Creation
In Linux, users and groups are fundamental for controlling access to resources and maintaining security.
Creating Users:
useradd: Used to create a new user.
bash
sudo useradd newuser
To assign a password: sudo passwd newuser
Creating Groups:
groupadd: Creates a new group.
bash
sudo groupadd newgroup
Assigning a User to a Group:
usermod: Used to modify a user's settings, including adding them to a group.
bash
Copy
sudo usermod -aG newgroup newuser
The -aG flag appends the user to the group without removing them from other groups.
User and Group Management:
List users: cat /etc/passwd
List groups: cat /etc/group
Change user’s primary group: sudo usermod -g newgroup newuser
5. User Ownership and Permissions
Understanding file permissions and ownership is crucial for maintaining a secure and efficient system.

File Permissions:
Permissions for files and directories are represented as a 10-character string:
diff
-rwxr-xr-x
The first character denotes file type (e.g., d for directory, - for regular file).
The next three characters represent the owner’s permissions (r=read, w=write, x=execute).
The second set represents the group’s permissions.
The final set represents others’ permissions.
Modifying Ownership and Permissions:
chmod: Change file permissions.
bash
chmod 755 filename
chown: Change the owner of a file.
bash
sudo chown user:group filename
chgrp: Change the group ownership of a file.
bash
sudo chgrp group filename
Special Permissions:
Setuid (s): When set on an executable file, the file is run with the permissions of the file’s owner.
Setgid (s): Similar to setuid, but the file is run with the permissions of the group.
Sticky bit: Ensures only the file owner can delete files within a directory.
6. Linux Networking
Linux offers powerful networking tools to manage and troubleshoot network connections.

Common networking commands:
ifconfig or ip a: Shows network interfaces and their IP addresses.
ping: Checks if a host is reachable over the network.
Copy
ping 192.168.1.1
netstat: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
ss: Similar to netstat, but faster and more modern.
traceroute: Traces the route packets take to reach a destination.
bash
Copy
traceroute google.com
nslookup or dig: Look up DNS records.
nslookup google.com
Setting up a network interface:
nmcli: NetworkManager command-line tool to configure network settings.
ip link set eth0 up: Activates a network interface (eth0).

7. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
Inter-process communication (IPC) allows processes to communicate with each other. In Linux, IPC mechanisms include:
Common IPC methods:
Pipes: Used to pass data between processes.
Anonymous pipes: Used between related processes (e.g., parent and child).
Named pipes (FIFOs): Used between unrelated processes.
Message Queues: Allow processes to send and receive messages in an ordered manner.
Shared Memory: Allows multiple processes to access the same memory space.
Semaphores: Used to synchronize processes to avoid conflicts when accessing shared resources.
Sockets: A more complex IPC method used for communication over networks.
Examples of IPC in the terminal:
Pipes:
ls | grep "file"
This passes the output of ls to grep to filter files.

Named Pipe (FIFO):
mkfifo mypipe
echo "Hello" > mypipe
cat < mypipe
