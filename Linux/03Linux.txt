Disk Usage and Working with Multiple Files
Disk Usage:
df: Displays disk space usage for mounted file systems.
du: Shows the disk usage of files and directories.
Working with Multiple Files:
Wildcards: Used for batch operations across multiple files (e.g., *, ?).
find: Used to search for files based on certain criteria like name, size, or modification time.
xargs: Passes output from one command to another for further processing.
tar: Used for working with file archives, such as creating and extracting tarballs.
2. Working with Processes
Process Management:
ps: Displays information about running processes.
top: Provides a real-time, interactive display of processes and resource usage.
htop: A more advanced, colorized version of top that provides detailed information about system processes.
kill: Terminates processes by process ID (PID).
killall: Terminates all processes with a specific name.
nice and renice: Used to adjust the priority of processes.
nohup: Runs a command in the background even after the user logs out.
Background Processes:
&: Runs a command in the background.
fg: Brings a background process to the foreground.
3. Basics of Networking
Networking Commands:
ifconfig or ip a: Displays network interface details, such as IP addresses.
ping: Tests connectivity to another host.
traceroute: Traces the path packets take to a remote host.
netstat: Displays active network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics.
ss: A faster, more modern alternative to netstat for viewing socket statistics.
nslookup or dig: Queries DNS information for a domain name.
ip route: Displays or manipulates the routing table.
wget: Downloads files from the web.
4. VI Editor
The VI editor is a terminal-based text editor that operates in three main modes:

Normal Mode: Default mode, used for navigation and executing commands.
Insert Mode: For inserting and editing text.
Command Mode: For file operations such as saving, quitting, or modifying file content.
Common tasks include:

Opening, editing, saving, and quitting files.
Navigating through the file using keybindings.
Searching and replacing text.
Performing various file manipulations (cut, copy, paste, etc.).
5. Ownership and Permissions
Linux uses a permission model to control access to files and directories:

User Ownership: Each file has an owner, typically the user who created the file.
Group Ownership: Files belong to a group, and each group can have different access permissions.
Permissions: Determine what actions can be performed on files by users. The three main permissions are read (r), write (w), and execute (x).
Owner: Permissions granted to the file’s owner.
Group: Permissions granted to the file’s associated group.
Others: Permissions granted to everyone else.
Common file permission operations:

chmod: Used to change file permissions.
chown: Changes the ownership of a file.
chgrp: Changes the group ownership of a file

Remote Connections
Remote connections allow you to access and control a system from a different location, usually over a network. Linux provides several tools for establishing remote connections:

SSH (Secure Shell): The most common and secure method for remotely accessing a Linux machine. SSH allows encrypted communication between a client and a server, providing terminal access and remote command execution.

SCP (Secure Copy): A command-line tool for securely copying files between hosts over a network using SSH.

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol): A secure alternative to FTP, used for transferring files over a network through an encrypted SSH connection.

VNC (Virtual Network Computing): A graphical desktop-sharing system that allows remote control of a computer using a graphical interface.

Telnet: An older, insecure method of accessing remote systems, now generally replaced by SSH.

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): Used mainly on Windows systems but can be used to access Linux with the appropriate software.

2. Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions and serves as both a command-line interpreter and a scripting language. It is an enhanced version of the original Bourne Shell (sh), providing more features such as better scripting capabilities, job control, and improved interactive use.

Key Features of Bash:
Command-Line Interface: Allows users to enter and execute commands interactively.
Scripting Language: Bash can be used to write scripts for automating tasks.
Job Control: Bash supports background jobs and job management, allowing tasks to be run concurrently or in the background.
Tab Completion: Automatically completes commands, filenames, and other arguments based on context.
Bash processes input in two ways:

Interactive Mode: Where a user types commands directly into the terminal.
Non-interactive Mode: Where commands are executed in a script or from a file.
3. Important Bash Variables
Bash uses environment variables to store information that controls the behavior of the shell and its environment. Here are some important Bash variables:

$HOME: The home directory of the current user. It's the default location where users start when they log in.
$PATH: A colon-separated list of directories that are searched when a command is entered. It determines where the system looks for executables.
$USER: The username of the current user.
$PWD: The current working directory.
$SHELL: The path to the current shell being used.
$PS1: Defines the primary prompt string. It controls how the prompt appears in the terminal.
$LANG: Determines the system language and locale settings.
$TERM: Specifies the terminal type (e.g., xterm, vt100).
$EDITOR: Specifies the default text editor for the system (used by many programs to invoke an editor).
These variables can be referenced or modified within the shell or in scripts to control the shell's behavior.

4. The Bash Logout File
The Bash logout file is executed when a user logs out from a shell session. These files can be used to clean up or perform any tasks that need to be done after the user ends their session.

~/.bash_logout: This is the default logout script for a user. When the user exits a session, commands in this file are executed. It is typically used to clear temporary files, remove history, or perform cleanup tasks.

Examples of tasks often included in .bash_logout:
Clear the terminal screen.
Delete temporary files created during the session.
Erase or modify shell history files to maintain privacy or security.
5. Command Line Essentials
The command line is a powerful interface that allows users to interact with the operating system and perform various tasks. Here are some essential concepts and commands related to the command line:

Basic Command Structure:
A command typically consists of:
Command: The main executable or tool you want to run.
Options: Flags or switches that modify the behavior of the command (e.g., -v for verbose).
Arguments: The targets or data that the command will operate on (e.g., filenames or directories).
Essential Commands:
ls: Lists files and directories.
cd: Changes the current directory.
pwd: Displays the present working directory.
cp: Copies files or directories.
mv: Moves or renames files and directories.
rm: Removes files or directories.
cat: Displays the contents of a file.
echo: Prints text or variables to the screen.
man: Displays the manual page for a command, providing detailed information about its usage.
history: Displays a list of previously entered commands.
clear: Clears the terminal screen.
exit: Exits the shell or terminates the session.
Redirection and Pipes:
Redirection allows you to send the output of one command to a file or another command:

>: Redirects output to a file, overwriting it.
>>: Redirects output to a file, appending to the file.
<: Takes input from a file.
Pipes (|) allow you to send the output of one command to another command.

Example: ls | grep "txt" will list files and then filter the output to show only those containing "txt".
Using Wildcards:
*: Matches any string of characters, including none.
?: Matches exactly one character.
[]: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.
Job Control:
&: Executes a command in the background.
bg: Resumes a suspended job in the background.
fg: Brings a job from the background to the foreground.
jobs: Lists the background jobs.
kill: Terminates a process by its PID.
File Permissions and Ownership:
chmod: Changes file permissions.
chown: Changes file ownership.
chgrp: Changes group ownership of a file.
Searching for Files:
find: Searches for files and directories in a directory hierarchy.
grep: Searches for specific patterns in files.
locate: Finds files by name using a prebuilt database.
Conclusion:
Remote Connections enable you to access and control systems over the network, with tools like SSH, SCP, and SFTP.
Bash is the default shell for most Linux systems, providing an interface for interacting with the system and a powerful scripting language.
Bash Variables allow customization and control of the shell environment and behavior.
The Bash Logout File provides a mechanism to run commands when a user logs out, often used for cleanup tasks.
Command Line Essentials are fundamental to effective interaction with a Linux system, covering essential commands, file manipulation, job control, and process management.
